# #tutorial 3 Various string functions

# name = "shahmir khan"
# print(name.capitalize()) #if there is a space in your string then just the first letter will be capitalized
# print(name.upper()) # lower also works
# print(name.find("o"))#will return -1 b/c it doesn't exist
# print(name.find("s"))
# print(name.find("r"))
# # other string methods are much more like "isdigit",isalpha, len,lower, count, replace, etc

#tutorial 04 Casting

y=(float(2)) #int
x=float((3.0)) #float
s=float(("4"))#string

print(y)
print(x) # or you can do it permanently by x=int(x)
print(s*3)
